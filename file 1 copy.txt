A straight forward knowledge tranfer algorithm for Extereme Machine Learning in time varied 

Abstract
	Knowledge transfer - Incremental learning - Introduction
	Why do we need knowledge transfer
		different set of images (formats) - size varied 
	Extreme Learning machine for image classification
	problem statement
		different set of images at different times - size
	Solution
		Creating multiple train models for all set and incorporating the knowledge transfer amoung the models
	Tested
		using various standard datasets like, mnist, imagenet, places205, cifar-10 and 100

Introudction
	Knowledge transfer and incremental learning - introduction
	extreme machine learning - breif intro - why not other algorithms (MLP, DBN, DBM, SAE, SDAE, CNN) - for image classification
	Importance of Knowledge transfer 
	Proposed work

Proposed algorithm - Knowledge Transfer
	Algorithm 
	Proof of concept
		a = b + c
		where a = values got while considering all the inputs [mnist - all images][no split up]
		      b = values got for first split up
		      c = values got for second split up 
			--- so on.

Experimental Results and Analysis
	
	Dataset
		mnist, imagenet, places205, cifar-10 and 100

		mnist - splitted - 	tested with different size 
			[size - 15x15]	28
